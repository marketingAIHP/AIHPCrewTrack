Tasks to fix and implement:

1. **Employee Creation**  
   - Fix the error: "failed to create employee".  
   - Ensure employee data is correctly validated, saved in MongoDB, and returned in API response.  
   - Make sure employee creation works only under the correct admin who created them.  
   - Verify employee appears instantly in that admin’s dashboard after creation.

2. **SendGrid Integration**  
   - Generate a new SendGrid API key (do **not** commit it to the repo).  
   - Store the key securely via environment variables (e.g., `SENDGRID_API_KEY`).  
   - **Removed committed key** – environment variables are now the only source.  
   - Ensure key handling in code pulls from environment variables only.  
   - Test email sending across report export and admin verification flows.

3. **Employee Dashboard & Profile**  
   - Fix employee dashboard so profile picture loads properly after login.  
   - If no profile picture exists, show a default placeholder image.  
   - On clicking employee name, open update view.  
   - Allow employee to update only limited fields (phone, address, profile picture).  
   - Ensure updated data syncs with database and reflects in UI without page reload.

4. **Export Report**  
   - Fix "export failed" and "failed to send email" errors.  
   - Ensure reports are generated, exported, and emailed successfully via SendGrid.  
   - Add proper error handling and user-friendly error messages.

5. **Geofencing Optimization**  
   - Fix inaccurate distance detection (showing 130m away even when on site).  
   - Use accurate GPS/Geolocation API with tolerance levels.  
   - Ensure geofence radius works properly for attendance logging.

6. **Super Admin Role**  
   - Implement a Super Admin who controls admin verification.  
   - When a new admin is created, send confirmation email.  
   - Only after email verification, allow admin account to be active.  
   - Super Admin can deactivate or approve admin accounts.

7. **Full System Check**  
   - Test end-to-end flows: employee creation, profile update, attendance tracking, report export, email sending, admin verification.  
   - Identify and fix any other hidden issues.  
   - Provide clear setup instructions for environment variables and configurations.

Requirements:
- Deliver complete working fixes with updated file structure if needed.  
- Ensure secure role-based access control (Super Admin > Admin > Employee).  
- Use React + TypeScript hooks, Node.js best practices, and MongoDB validation.  
- Add comments explaining fixes and instructions for running the project.
